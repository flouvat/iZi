\subsection{Detailed Description}
{\bf Boolean}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{class_boolean})} type. 

This class is created since their is a problem with vector$<$bool$>$::iterator in the STL. It returns a temporary \_\-Bit\_\-Reference rather than a \char`\"{}proper\char`\"{} reference. Vector$<$bool$>$ isn't a proper container and it's iterators don't satisfy the conditions for forward iterators. For more details see: {\tt http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2005-03/msg00148.html} 



The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{CompactItemize}
